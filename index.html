	<p>Hi, welcome to my Github page.</p><br>
	
	<p>
	I hope to get a blog up and running about some topics of interest to me such as Angular, Ionic and Spring. 
	However, things tend to happen a lot more slowly than I would like, 
	in the mean time you can check out some of the following links of things I have created.
	</p><br>

	<p>
		<b>Wacky Car Rental Demo</b><br>
	    First, I am in the process of creating a demo angular app to hopefully, one day, cover some advanced features
	    of Angular such as routing, lazy loading, creating dynamic modules and components to think of a few.
	    Rememeber, this is still a work in progress, so try checking back every now and then.<br>

	</p>

		<b>Angular Password Helper</b><br>
	    When Angular2 came out, this was my first attempt at using it to create a reusable component.<br>
